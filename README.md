<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This is a collection of different projects completed in my spare time to further enhance my knowledge of programming and software development.

The idea is to become a better fullstack developer, researching and developing with new technologies that are on the horizon.

I first started with Angular for the frontend but found development time was slower due to learning a new framework. I have since decided to use the SvelteKit framework for the frontend for its simplicity and reasonable performance as its compiled. Spring Boot/Java was used for the backend as I simply like Java lol.

<!-- Projects -->

## Projects

This is the collection of ongoing projects I'm currently working on.

### Leetcode

This is a project dedicated to the solutions of leetcode problems. It is meant to enhance my programming and problem solving skills.

### SARA v2

This is a project dedicated to rebuilding my college project called SARA (Search and Reporting Application). It is a basic search engine built with PHP paired with a basic UI built in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I wanted to rebuild this project with the experience I've gained in the industry.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [x] Retiring Angular (Love it, but it's more than this project needs)
